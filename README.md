## 📊 Project Motivation & Case Study

Access to affordable medication is a critical issue globally. Here's why generic medicines matter:

### 1. Significant Cost Savings
- In the U.S., switching to generic drugs in 2020 resulted in approximately **[$338 billion](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/expanding-use-generic-drugs-0)** in healthcare savings, with a projected **[$2.4 trillion](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/expanding-use-generic-drugs-0)** over 10 years.  
- Generic medicines are typically **[80–85% cheaper](https://uc.healthnetcalifornia.com/health-wellness/generic-drugs.html)** than brand-name equivalents.  
- Globally, generic medicines generated **[$265 billion in savings](https://accessiblemeds.org/resources/press-releases/generic-drug-competition-lowers-prescription-cost-6-average-study-finds)**, including **$82.7 billion for Medicare** and **$40.6 billion for Medicaid**. The **average copay** for a generic prescription is just **$6.06**.  

### 2. Comparable Safety & Efficacy
- Studies show that **[87% of patients consider generic drugs equally effective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4870419/)**, and **[88% perceive them to be equally safe](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4870419/)**.  
- Regulatory bodies like the **[FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/generic-drugs/generic-drug-facts)** ensure generic drugs have the same active ingredients, dosage form, and efficacy as brand-name counterparts, thanks to strict **bioequivalence standards**.  

### 3. National Impact: India’s Jan Aushadhi Initiative
- The **Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)** has helped India save **[₹130,000 crore (~₹1.3 trillion) over the last decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_medicine_in_India)**, with **[₹15,000 crore saved in FY 2024–25 alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_medicine_in_India)**.  
- Generic alternatives under PMBJP are priced **[50–90% lower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhan_Mantri_Bharatiya_Janaushadhi_Pariyojana)** than branded medicines.
